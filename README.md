# Drinks
The Drinks program is used to help decide what to drink. The user inputs the ingredients that they own into the program. The program then outputs what recipes the user can make with those ingredients. The program also calculates based off those owned ingredients which other recipes the user can make if they were to buy other ingredients. It was made so the user can buy the least amount of ingredients to make the most recipes.Â
